Nine in 10 payday loan complaints to the Better Business Bureau are made against online lenders, although online loans account for only about one-third of the market.  Most complaints deal with billing or collections issues, which include unauthorized bank debits, failure to explain or substantiate charges, failure to correct billing errors, and improper collection practices. Other reported problems include fraud, harassment, and dissemination of personal information.
Online payday loans are usually more expensive than store loans. Lump-sum loans online typically cost $25 per $100 borrowed per pay period—an approximately 650 percent annual percentage rate. Online installment loans, which are paid back over time in smaller increments, range in price from around 300 percent APR—a rate similar to those charged for store-issued payday installment loans—to more than 700 percent APR from lenders who are not licensed in all of the states where they lend. The main driver of these high costs is the frequency with which loans are not repaid: Defaults are more common in online lending than in storefront lending.
