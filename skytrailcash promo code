Many online loans are designed to promote renewals and long-term indebtedness. One in 3 online borrowers has taken out a loan that was set up to withdraw only the fee on the customer’s next payday, automatically renewing the loan without reducing principal. To pay more, most of these borrowers had to make a request by phone. Other online loans increase borrowers’ costs with unnecessarily long repayment periods, such as eight months to pay off a $300 loan or by including some payments in the installment schedule that do not reduce the balance.
30 percent of online payday loan borrowers report being threatened by a lender or debt collector. Threatened actions include contacting borrowers’ family, friends, or employers, and arrest by the police. Online borrowers report being threatened at far higher rates than do storefront borrowers, and many of the types of threats violate federal debt collection laws.
